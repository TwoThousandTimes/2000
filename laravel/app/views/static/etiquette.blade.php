<h2>Community Etiquette</h2>
	<p>The Two Thousand Times community guidelines detail the values desired by its users. Please respect them and remember that others read what you share.</p>
	<h3>Do</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Behave online as you would in real life.</span> The lack of a user’s real life identity is to promote conversations and storytelling that would otherwise go unheard. Add value to our community and its discussions. Purely hateful expressions are unnecessary both on-and-offline.</li>
		<li><span>Read our guidelines.</span> Check them occasionally, our guidelines are a fluid document of the community. Tell us your thoughts at <a href="mailto:feedback@twothousandtimes.com">feedback@twothousandtimes.com</a>. Developments are based in your feedback.</li>
		<li><span>Do your best to use proper grammar and spelling.</span> Honest expression and storytelling is most important, but Grammar Nazism is inevitable. Please be open to constructive criticism.</li>
		<li><span>Like deserving content.</span> If you think a submission is worthwhile, like it. Your responses ensure visibility for the highest quality content.</li>
		<li><span>Report spam.</span></li>
		<li><span>Browse new submissions.</span> Reposting or favoriting worthy new submissions is a commendable community service.</li>
		<li><span>Submit to the most appropriate categories.</span> Also, consider cross posting (up to three categories) if appropriate.</li>
		<li><span>Scan your submission for mistakes before posting.</span> Titles and photos cannot be edited once a submission is made. Your content can be edited within 72 hours of posting. Make sure your submission is complete before posting.</li>
		<li><span>Comment:</span> Positive comments make this community more enjoyable and engaging. The best way to get others to interact with the content you share is to do so yourself.</li>
		<li><span>Leave Feedback:</span> The Two Thousand Times is young and we look to improve it on a daily basis. Please don’t hesitate to share your experience with the site - your input holds weight and will always be appreciated, whether positive or negative.</li>
		<li><span>Spread The Word:</span> One of our biggest sources of excitement in developing this platform is creating the opportunity for friends, family, and co-workers to share the ideas and experiences which wouldn’t normally arise in day-to-day interaction. We hope you share our excitement. While this is an opportunity for you to share your experiences and express your ideas, it is also an opportunity to see what those around you have to say.</li>
		<li><span>Remain Engaged.</span> Don’t expect others to interact with you if you’re not doing so yourself.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Don't</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Engage in illegal activity.</span></li>
		<li><span>Post someone's personal information.</span> Please respect the privacy of others. This applies to two groups of individuals:
			<ul>
				<li><span>Site Users:</span> If you find yourself identifying certain users through their submissions or comments, please do not reveal their identity - any posts or comments attempting this will be removed, and your account will be subject to immediate deletion. Even if you find a user’s material offensive, your attempts at persecuting or outing these users will bring your account and activity under review. Please share our commitment to user privacy: if you see a user engaging in any questionable conduct regarding personal information, contact our site admins at <a href="mailto:admin@twothousandtimes.com">admin@twothousandtimes.com</a>.</li>
				<li><span>Individuals included in your submissions:</span> Use your best judgment when mentioning the people involved in your posts. You are responsible for any repercussions which may arise from sharing the identity of real life individuals. The best way to avoid these repercussions is by changing individuals’ names and the locations involved in your submissions.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span>Re-submit deleted/removed information.</span> Submissions and comments are deleted by users for a reason. Regardless of their content or context, do not explain, re-create or repost deleted materials.</li>
		<li><span>Engage in intentionally rude or hateful conduct.</span> Respectful interaction and constructive criticism encourages worthwhile discussion, while offensive behavior only damages the community. Personal attacks, insults, and flame wars are immature and unnecessary.</li>
		<li><span>Spam.</span> Excessive posting of identical or nonsensical submissions and comments will get your account blocked by our spam filters. Repeat spammers will have their accounts deleted.</li>
		<li><span>Troll.</span> A troll thrives on attention. Resist giving them yours.</li>
		<li><span>Blatantly plagiarize.</span> All submissions should be original with their intent. Plagiarized materials are to be reported and will be removed. Consistent plagiarism will result in account deletion.</li>
		<li><span>Submit list based posts.</span> Eg. “Top Ten Reason 90’s Kids Rule.”</li>
		<li><span>Report submissions purely on personal opinion.</span> Submissions are to be reported if they break community guidelines, not because you disagree with their content.</li>
		<li><span>Shamelessly self promote.</span> Mentioning, “Reposting this would really mean a lot to me” at the end of your submission is a sure fire way to lose potential likes and follows. Titles, taglines, and submissions featuring "#TeamFollowback," “Like if you’ve done the same,” etc. are prohibited. This also includes messaging others, offering gifts, and creating mass campaigns for likes, reposts, and favorites.</li>
		<li><span>Include hyperlinks.</span> Hyperlinks won’t function within submissions. Do not enter a url and tell others to copy and paste it into their address bar.</li>
		<li><span>Make nothing comments.</span> Stating that you’re “first” on a submission’s comments adds no value to the conversation.</li>
		<p><span>Protest the lack of attention your submission received.</span> Please do not make additional submissions voicing your complaints. They will be poorly received. Consistent, quality submissions will eventually gain the attention they deserve.</p>
	</ul>
